“Empty.” The words sounded foreign to him, spoken in a forgotten language and a voice that was not his. 
“Cold.” Beads of sweat rolled down his forehead as the sky burned with fire, yet he could only dream of its warm embrace. 
“Wet.” It surrounded him, an endless horizon of movement, bobbing up and down to its own unheard rhythm. 
“Forgotten.” Minutes turned to hours as he lay there motionless, his thoughts lost to the unforgiving sea. 
“Alone.” The trip began with many, poor souls searching for a new beginning, now there was only one. 
“Acceptance.” There was no resistance nor was there fear, only the treacherous veil of bliss. 
“Strange.” Unfamiliar shapes formed upon the horizon growing larger and drawing closer. 
“Found.” Welded hands reached out toward his broken frame swallowing him whole. 
“Questions.” Many voices and languages, yet only one question. 
“Metal…” Tears ran down his face as he forced himself to grin. “It sank.”

The man lay motionless in his bed, eyes fixed upon the ceiling staring into emptiness. 
“Memories, that’s all they are. Memories, nothing more.” 
Rising from bed was no easy task for him. 
Age had not been kind upon his body; years of constant work had taken their toll. 
His physical condition consisted of frail bones, weak lungs, rust in his bloodstream and a missing arm. 
His mental condition could be summed up with one word, stubborn. 
Work was work to him. 
Simply he worked just because he could and paid no heed to those who warned him not to. 
He had placed yesterdays mail upon the coffee table, all of it junk mail with the exception of a small letter. 
There was only one word printed on its face, his name.
