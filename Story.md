# Outsider

“Empty.” The words sounded foreign to him, spoken in a forgotten language and a voice that was not his. 
“Cold.” Beads of sweat rolled down his forehead as the sky burned with fire, yet he could only dream of its warm embrace. 
“Wet.” It surrounded him, an endless horizon of movement, bobbing up and down to its own unheard rhythm. 
“Forgotten.” Minutes turned to hours as he lay there motionless, his thoughts lost to the unforgiving sea. 
“Alone.” The trip began with many, poor souls searching for a new beginning, now there was only one. 
“Acceptance.” There was no resistance nor was there fear, only the treacherous veil of bliss. 
“Strange.” Unfamiliar shapes formed upon the horizon growing larger and drawing closer. 
“Found.” Welded hands reached out toward his broken frame swallowing him whole. 
“Questions.” Many voices and languages, yet only one question. 
“Metal…” Tears ran down his face as he forced himself to grin. “It sank.”
