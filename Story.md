# Outsider

  “Empty.” The words sounded foreign to him, spoken in a forgotten language and a voice that was not his. 
“Cold.” Beads of sweat rolled down his forehead as the sky burned with fire, yet he could only dream of its warm embrace. 
“Wet.” It surrounded him, an endless horizon of movement, bobbing up and down to its own unheard rhythm. 
“Forgotten.” Minutes turned to hours as he lay there motionless, his thoughts lost to the unforgiving sea. 
“Alone.” The trip began with many, poor souls searching for a new beginning, now there was only one. 
“Acceptance.” There was no resistance nor was there fear, only the treacherous veil of bliss. 
“Strange.” Unfamiliar shapes formed upon the horizon growing larger and drawing closer. 
“Found.” Welded hands reached out toward his broken frame swallowing him whole. 
“Questions.” Many voices and languages, yet only one question. 
“Metal…” Tears ran down his face as he forced himself to grin. “It sank.”

  The man lay motionless in his bed, eyes fixed upon the ceiling staring into emptiness. 
“Memories, that’s all they are. Memories, nothing more.” Rising from bed was no easy task for him. 
Age had not been kind upon his body; years of constant work had taken their toll. 
His physical condition consisted of frail bones, weak lungs, rust in his bloodstream and a missing arm. 
His mental condition could be summed up with one word, stubborn. 
Work was work to him. 
Simply he worked just because he could and paid no heed to those who warned him not to. 
He had placed yesterdays mail upon the coffee table, all of it junk mail with the exception of a small letter. 
There was only one word printed on its face, his name.

  He was born in a city floating on water, its name forgotten to time but its beauty shining like never before. 
Most of his life was spent working within the numerous factories that surrounded the city, performing maintenance cheeks upon the monsters kept in the middle of each building.
Huge machines that consumed raw materials with their metal teeth and defecated products of unimaginable beauty and design. 
They bellowed with their mechanical voices and fumed thick clouds of rust and smoke.
To the monsters, it didn’t matter what they consumed, their excrement’s where always the same. 
An outsider would view the city as a marvelous wonder, those who lived there knew the truth and would often mumble a strange phrase “Shiny on the outside, yet rotten to the core.”
	
  The letters envelope had a strange outlandish design upon it, one that appeared to be nothing more than random scribbles that stung the eyes of its beholder if stared at for to long. 
The letter itself was blank. 
No word, no drawings, nor scratches or indents, just a plain blank sheet of paper. 
His mind began to race with questions. 
Who sent this letter? Where was the letter from?
Why was that peculiar design upon the envelope? 
Why must the world change so much? Why can’t I remember her name? 
Questions that he, who had asked himself one to many times in the past, knew had an answer yet he was not the one to find it. 

  He believed his place in this world was absolute, that those with the power and the money would be nothing without him. Wealthy business men who could get away with murder, spouses of politicians who believed that they could lie about their sins and face no repercussions, and presidents whose own words only served as a rope to hang their feet by.
He wasn’t a politician nor did he have incredible wealth, he was just an ordinary citizen who was dedicated to his work. 
To him, retirement would come when his casket was covered by dirt and the grass grew back over it. 
Legally he was handicapped, losing his right arm to one of the monsters in his youth and replacing it with a mechanical prosthetic wired directly to his brain.
The prosthetic carried the aroma of rusted metal and rust and was rough to the touch. 
Those who had more wealth could afford high quality prosthetics that where sleek and elegant. 
He didn’t care if his arm looked like an old power tool that one would find in the back of a shed, he knew what went into the more expensive models, and sickened at the idea of wearing that.
